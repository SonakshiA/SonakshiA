### 🪧 My favourite projects :

- Wordict: Being an avid reader, I developed this app to allow readers to store a new word they encounter, its synonyms, usage in a sentence and where they encountered the word.

- QuizApp: I wanted to incorporate APIs in my application, so I fetched results from The Trivia App API and made a quiz game.

- WhatsappUI: I coded this project to get my hands dirty on Jetpack Compose.

- RedditUI: I coded Reddit's UI using Jetpack Compose.

- IEEE WIE MUJ's website: As the Head of Technical Projects, I designed and developed a website for IEEE's Women in Engineering society in my university.

- Mumbae: This was the first of many ambitious projects I worked on to sharpen my dev skills. Mumbae is a read-only app that shows popular places in Mumbai, famous shopping outlets, eateries and important emergency contacts.
